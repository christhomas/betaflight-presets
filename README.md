# betaflight-presets
This is all my betaflight presets that I use for my quads. Having them online like this allows me to use the mobile app to apply them to my drones

# Structure
- `/betaflight` Files in the root directory contain information about drones that I have configured
- `/vtx` JSON Configuration tables for vtx devices
- `/rx-firmware` Various drone ELRS RX firmware that I compiled, so I can restore them quickly if needed
- `/edgetx-models` Backup of the edgetx models from my transmitter controllers
